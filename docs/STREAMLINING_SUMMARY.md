# STREAMLINING SUMMARY
## Mira Labs Pitch Deck - Simplification & Sales Focus

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Session:** User Feedback Implementation - "Too Much Content"
**Status:** ✅ STREAMLINING COMPLETED

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Based on critical user feedback that the presentation was "too much" and "killing the sale," the pitch deck has been streamlined from **13 slides to 10 slides**. Key changes:

- **DELETED:** Slide 11 (Regulatory Risk) - explicitly "kills the sale momentum"
- **REMOVED:** Slide 02 (Market Opportunity) and Slide 04 (Competitive Landscape) - excessive data
- **REDESIGNED:** Slide 02 (Executive Summary) - simplified to "The Opportunity" with better visuals
- **RESULT:** Cleaner, more sales-focused presentation with stronger opening

---

## USER FEEDBACK (Verbatim)

> "siento que es mucho, osea la parte de la diapositiva 13, siento que me mata la venta, y las primeras 3 slides siento que no estan bien, aparte, no se si se arreglaron las parrtes de ux/ui del md file"

**Translation:**
- Slide 13 (Regulatory Risk) kills the sale
- First 3 slides aren't working well
- Uncertain if UX/UI recommendations from documentation were implemented

---

## CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ 1. DELETED Slide 11 - Regulatory Risk

**Rationale:** User explicitly stated this slide "kills the sale momentum"

**Action Taken:**
- ❌ **DELETED FILE:** `/src/slides/Slide11RegulatoryRisk.tsx`
- ✅ **REMOVED from:** `/src/slides/index.ts` (export statement)
- ✅ **REMOVED from:** `/src/App.tsx` (import and slides array)

**Impact:** Presentation now ends on a strong note (Slide 10: Valuation Framework) instead of highlighting risks.

---

### ✅ 2. REMOVED Market Data Slides from Flow

**Rationale:** Too much data upfront overwhelms investors and weakens opening

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ **REMOVED from presentation flow:** `Slide02MarketOpportunity`
- ✅ **REMOVED from presentation flow:** `Slide04CompetitiveLandscape`
- ℹ️ **Files retained** for reference but not displayed in slides array

**Impact:** Investors now see:
1. Title
2. **The Opportunity** (Executive Summary)
3. Strategic Rationale
4. Leadership Team
5. ... (remaining slides)

Instead of being hit with market sizing and competitive matrices immediately.
