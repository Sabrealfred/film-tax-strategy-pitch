## INVESTOR COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES

### Standard Language for All Materials

**Pre-Seed to Series A Bridge:**
> "Mira Labs plans to raise Series A in Q2-Q3 2027, approximately 18-24 months following Pre-Seed close. This timeline allows for:
> 1. FINMA transfer completion and banking relationship stabilization (Q1 2026)
> 2. 12-month audited performance track record (Q1 2026 - Q1 2027)
> 3. AUM scale to $100-150M with demonstrated LOI conversion
> 4. Platform infrastructure validation through pilot compartments
>
> Series A target valuation: $50-75M pre-money, reflecting 2-2.5x AUM growth and operational de-risking."

**Fallback Language (if milestones slip):**
> "Series A timing is milestone-driven rather than calendar-driven. Target range: 18-30 months post Pre-Seed close, contingent on achieving $100M+ AUM, 12-month track record, and operational readiness."

## KEY DEPENDENCIES & RISK FACTORS

### Critical Path to Q2 2027 Target

```
Q4 2025: Pre-Seed close ✓
├─ Q1 2026: FINMA approval (90-150 days) ⚠️ HIGH RISK
├─ Q1 2026: Banking consent secured
├─ Q1 2026 - Q1 2027: Performance tracking (12 months)
├─ Q2 2026 - Q2 2027: LOI conversion + business development
├─ Q4 2026: SOC 2 Type I audit kickoff
└─ Q2 2027: Series A data room preparation

Buffers:
- 3-month regulatory delay → pushes to Q3 2027
- 6-month performance shortfall → pushes to Q4 2027 or Q1 2028
```

### Downside Scenarios

| Scenario | Impact | Revised Timeline |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| FINMA approval delayed 6 months | Track record starts Q3 2026 | Series A → Q4 2027 |
| LOI conversion < 20% | AUM growth insufficient | Series A → Q1 2028 or bridge round |
| Banking relationship disruption | Operations delayed 6-12 months | Series A → Q3 2028 or strategic pivot |
| Technology partner issues | Performance record compromised | Series A → TBD, may require partner acquisition |

## SIGN-OFF

**Recommendation:** Adopt **Q2-Q3 2027 (18-24 months post-close)** as standard Series A messaging across all investor-facing materials.

**Rationale:**
1. Aligns with 12-month track record requirement (Q1 2026 start → Q1 2027 complete)
2. Provides 6-month buffer for regulatory/operational delays
3. Consistent with Slide07 current language (most investor-visible)
4. Matches industry norms for institutional asset manager fundraising cycles

**Next Review:** Q1 2026 (post-FINMA approval) to validate timeline assumptions
